# Crewbee

Crewbee is a social platform for creators with a project in mind. There, they can find other participants or creators and organize meetings to realize their project (like a private hackathon).

Crewbee was made in 24 hours during the Telekom-Evernote-Hackathon (Berlin) in collaboration with @edokoa and @SableRaf in 2013.
